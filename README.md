## Install

```sh
npm install

An emulator or a physical device connected to your computer via USB is needed to run this application. To install an emulator follow this Documentation that we configured https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ax_QZISI5WKFNMx5ajIG7K7FdY1mqsKN4Ert_dbC-AQ/edit?usp=sharing. 

This will install all necessary packages including Expo which is critical for viewing the application. 

To run this project in ExpoGo a lightweight complied view use 'expo start'. 
This will allow you to experice all the screens of the application 
but will prevent you from access the emulators phone's camera and audio devices. 

To ensure a full experience of the application on the emulator download the apk from 
(https://expo.dev/accounts/aj-eh/projects/JoinYou/builds/3cf42e11-df9c-40ca-bef4-c69142602e0d) 
on the emulator and install application.
Then Run 'Expo start --dev-client'
```

## Usage

```sh
expo start or expo start --dev-start
```
